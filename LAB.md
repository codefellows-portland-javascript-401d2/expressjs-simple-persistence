## Description

For this assignment, rewrite your [`http-simple-persistence` assignment](../http-simple-persistence/LAB.md)
using ExpressJS.

Go ahead and cut and paste your data storage module(s) into this project, you shouldn't
need to rewrite those!

You API E2E tests should also be usable "as-is". Though correctness trumps re-use.

All requirements are still in play.
